## Coding Challenge Project

By Aaron Bolarinho

Hello and Welcome!

### Overview

This single page app was created for a coding test.

The challenge of this project was - over 3 hours - to create a speed typing game according to a set of criteria.

Used in this project:

 - Create-react-app
 - Html, CSS, and basic front-end formatting
 - Axios for api calls
 - A timer from [https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-compound-timer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-compound-timer)

** Project Final Thoughts and Plans**

The time constraints on this project forced me to focus on producing an mvp first; and that left little time for additional features.

If I had an extra day, I would:

Css: 
- Re-organise the Css and the positioning of elements
- Add some extra fonts
- Add some transition effects for each new word and for some of the text changes

App Functionality:
- implement a leaderboard using [http://myjson.com/api](http://myjson.com/api)
- track how long it takes for each word to be entered. When each word is complete, display a message to the user such as:
  - 1 sec: "Amazing"
  - 2 sec: "Saaweeet"
  - 3 sec: "Noice"
  - 4 sec: "Not bad, Not bad"
  - 5 sec: "Keep going!"
  - 6 sec or more: "the timer IS ticking you know...."
 
- Also add scaling point for how fast you got the word:
  -  1 sec: 10 pts
  - 2 sec:  8 pts
  - 3 sec:  6 pts
  - 4 sec: 4 pts
  - 5 sec: 2 pts
  - 6 sec or more: 1 pts

If I had an extra week, I would:

- implement some visual tracker (like a progress bar or something) that averages the speed of each word entry to give the user an overall average speed
- This overall average speed would then provide praise style feedback just like each individual word entry
- It would also be neat to add some functionality where that information is stored so a user can compete against themselves both on overall points scored but also on their last sessions average time, as it developed.
- implement a drop down menu on the timer so that users could choose their time: from, say, 1,2,3,5,10 minutes
- implement a easy, medium, and hard mode button where the api words returned are filtered for length, then given back to the user according to their word length preference.

** Project Final Thoughts and Plans**

The time constraints on this project forced me to focus on producing an mvp first; and that left little time for additional features.

I started off by installing create-react-app, getting the initial home-page together, then testing out the api calls and how to implement with Netlify. That done, I implemented all the functionality of the site. Finally, I did a little css with the html elements.

If I had an extra day, I would:

Css: 
- Re-organise the Css and the positioning of elements; make it mobile friendly
- Add some extra fonts
- Add some transition effects for each new word and for some of the text changes

App Functionality:
- implement a leaderboard using [http://myjson.com/api](http://myjson.com/api)
- track how long it takes for each word to be entered. When each word is complete, display a message to the user such as:
  - 1 sec: "Amazing"
  - 2 sec: "Saaweeet"
  - 3 sec: "Noice"
